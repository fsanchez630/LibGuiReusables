\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Software development has never been a simple task.
 At least a text editor has been required, where to write the program, and
 a compiler or interpreter that would take the necessary steps with the
 set of files of the program so that it could be executed.
 In addition, almost all programs today have a Graphical Interface (GUI),
 which consists of a set of windows and menus that allow the user to interact
 with the software and provide the most satisfactory experience possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Currently the coding of programs and the creation of the graphical interfaces
 can be created through the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) in
 its Coding view and in the Design view, respectively.
 This is closely related to the software architecture style called Model
 View Controller (MVC), which separates an application's user data, user
 interface, and control logic into three different components.
 In this way, two main roles are distinguished: the GUI designer and the
 application developer.
 This project aims to make the task of both roles easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The main objective of this project is to facilitate the development of Software
 through a Library that allows the reuse of graphical user interfaces.

\series medium
 The library provides the functionality of a hierarchy of graphical interfaces
 and the mechanisms for integrating graphical interfaces of associated objects
 in a general GUI, but preserving the possibility of displaying individual
 tables when necessary without duplicating code or graphical components.
 The process is transparent to users and programmers, both those who design
 the GUIs and those who use them when programming applications.
 In addition, functionalities are also provided that allow the passage of
 messages between the GUIs and the recursion of the validation operations
 of the edition, data recording and completion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
With the functionalities that the Library provides, it is hoped to make
 the task of Software development a little easier.
